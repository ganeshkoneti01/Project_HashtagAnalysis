# Project_HashtagAnalysis

Twitter is one of the most popular social media used by thousands of users.
As the conversations grew thick and faster, a placeholder feature called as hash tags became important as it captured the themes be problems and the tweets. 
In the existing project classification of tweets is done manually which takes more time and may leads to some errors.To overcome this we have introduced this twitter hashtag analysis.
In this project we address the challenging problems regarding identifying a particular hash tag and finding out the number of tweets to that particular hash tag, finding out the followers of the hash tag, finding out the full text of the hash tag
